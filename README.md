This is a companion r package for the Book " Basic and Advanced Psychometrics in R" [work in Progress]

This package includes data-frames and some interesting commands. Over the years I have come across many useful hunk of codes in Stak over flow and github. I have included some of those  codes in this package. Whenever possible I have tried to mention the original source of the code in the description.
