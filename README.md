# baap

This is a companion r package for the Book " Basic and Advanced Psychometrics in R" [work in Progress]

This package includes data-frames and some interesting commands. Over the years I have come across many useful chunk of codes in Stak overflow and Github. I have included some of those codes in this package. Whenever possible I have tried to mention the original source of the code in the description.

You can install the package

    devtools::install_github("masiraji/baap")
